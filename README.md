Introduction of Custom Hash Table 
                      A custom hash table implementation refers to manually creating a hash table from scratch rather than using pre-built classes like HashMap or Hashtable in Java. This is often done to understand how hash tables work internally and to customize their behavior for specific needs.
                      
Describe the Custom Hash Table 
	A Custom Hash Table is a manually implemented version of a hash table data structure, built from scratch to mimic the behavior of built-in hash table implementations like Java's HashMap or Hashtable. It provides functionalities for efficient storage and retrieval of data using key-value pairs.
 
Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
	Creating a custom hash table enhances understanding of algorithms and data structures, contributes educational value to the developer community, and serves as a foundation for building specialized applications, making it a rewarding endeavor for personal growth and a valuable resource for solving unique software development challenges.
